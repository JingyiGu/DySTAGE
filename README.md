DySTAGE is a novel dynamic graph representation learning framework designed to enhance asset pricing prediction by capturing the evolving interrelationships among financial assets. Unlike traditional models that rely on static graphs or time series data, DySTAGE employs dynamic graph structures to represent the temporal and spatial dependencies of assets in financial networks. This enables the model to adapt to changes in asset composition and their correlations over time.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Graph Construction**: The framework dynamically constructs graphs from time series data to reflect the evolving asset interrelationships, accommodating asset additions and removals over time.
- **Spatio-Temporal Attention**: DySTAGE employs a combination of spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to capture both the topological (structural) and temporal (historical) patterns of asset behavior.
- **Graph Encodings**: Utilizes financial insights to design graph encodings that improve model performance, including importance, spatial, and edge correlation encodings.
- **Performance Optimization**: Demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and portfolio management outcomes over popular benchmarks, offering profitable investment strategies based on asset price prediction.
